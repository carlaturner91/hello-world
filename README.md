# hello-world
space to play and learn
I am new to the world of coding. I work in a place where we build WordPress websites and manage online presence. Currently I am doing a part-time course on HTML5, CSS3 and Responsive Design. I have a great teacher! My medium term goal is to move onto php and learn how to build WordPress Plugins.
